Arun tries to use Neural Nets for training on a dataset. He is not sure he will not
be stuck at local minima. So he trains thrice and each time starts with different
initial weights. The hypotheses are named h1, h2 and h3. 
On the validation set, h1 offers 90%, h2 80% and h3 60% accuracy. He doesn't want to
ignore any of them and decides to use ensemble learning. He assigns probabilities 
to the hypotheses by normalizing their accuracies. 

The neural net has two output neurons after softmax activation. The two neurons
represent + and - classes.

On a new query instance, at the first output neuron, h1 outputs 0.8, h2 outputs 0.4 
and h3 outputs 0.3.  

For the ensemble learning, he decides to use Bayesian Optimal classifier.
What is the class output by the B.O. Classifier for the new query instance???




(Answer: +ve class. Just)
